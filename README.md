Docker: Ensure Docker is installed on your machine. You can download it from using sudo apt pip install docker.
Docker Compose: Docker Compose is required to manage multi-container Docker applications. This usually comes bundled with Docker.

```
# Build the Docker Image
docker-compose build
# Run the application
docker-compose up
# Stop the application
docker-compose down

# For Troubleshooting you can use
docker-compose logs

# If you encounter permission issues while building, try running with sudo (for Linux):
sudo docker-compose build
sudo docker-compose up

# If you make changes to your code or Docker configurations, youâ€™ll need to rebuild the Docker image:
docker-compose up --build

```
